# Hello,

<img src="/project/img/me.png" alt="me" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: 300px;">

Hello! 

I am Hamza,

I am studying how to implement Machine Learning models on IOT Devices for my Masters of Science at McGill. This includes applications to Cloud computing and BlockChain.

I've studied Electrical Engineering with an Economics Minor during my undergrad. In my free time I like to follow my entrepeneurial spirit by developing Apps.
